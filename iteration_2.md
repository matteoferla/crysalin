# Iteration 2

This was a smaller number of redesigned residues, targeted to certain regions and not all at once.
Six design groups were made.

Additionally, five major changes were done in the code:

* Sidechain copying was rewritten to be more robust
* the TRB file was used to control was designed â€”I had not noticed this file before
* hydrophobic SASA was given a larger role in analysis
* The tuning was refactored
* The design definitions were by a YAML file

## Design definitions

The design definitions were moved to a YAML file [experiments_v2.yaml](experiments_v2.yaml).
The template is `pentakaihemimer_renumbered.pdb`.
Hotspots were redefined to be more specific.

### Bed

This is a loop that sits on the Rossmann fold.

Initial definitions:

    codename: bed
    change: 10-23
    contig: '[A5-9/14-32/A24-331/0 B1-651/0]'
    hotspots: '[B37,B39,B41,B43,B70,B71]'

Later definitions:

    codename: bedbig
    change: 10-23
    contig: '[A5-9/28-48/A24-331/0 B1-651/0]'

## Job submission
[pipeline.ipynb](code/iteration_2_slurm/pipeline.ipynb)

Say the experiment is bed4B (the notebook will generate the following commands):
```bash
export NUMDESIGNS=1000;
export EXPERIMENT=bed4B;
export HOTSPOTS='[B37,B39,B41,B43,B70,B71]';
export CONTIGMAP='[A5-9/14-32/A24-331/0 B1-651/0]';
sbatch rf.slurm.sh;

export WORKPATH_ROOT=ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾/output
export WORKPATH=$WORKPATH_ROOT/bed4B;
sbatch proteinMPNN.slurm.sh;

export EXPERIMENT=bed4B;
sbatch tune.slurm.sh;

export EXPERIMENT=bed4B;
sbatch rescore.slurm.sh;
```

Reference designs were made. One was the starting template, unaltered,
while the others were the region that was altered in the design groups,
which was stripped of sidechains, threaded with the original sequence and a polyglycine and then relaxed.
As expected by chance some of these performed better than the original, including some glycine designs.

A set of hard filters were applied to the designs based on the template.

* âˆ†G monomer < WT âˆ†G monomer
* âˆ†âˆ†G < WT âˆ†âˆ†G
* Number of streptavidin residues with 6Ã… (centroid) > WT number
* Maximum per residue score < WT maximum

A multi-term score was used to rank the designs.
The following metrics were Z-score normalised and tanh smoothened to taper values beyond Â±2 sigma,
within each group. The weighted-sums of terms were Z-score normalised within each group again.
The weights were chosen arbitrarily:

* âˆ†G monomer: 2.
* âˆ†âˆ†G: 1.
* RMSD: 0.8
* Hydrophobic sasa: 0.5
* N_close_residues_6: 0.5
* Change ratio: 0.3 (i.e. the fraction of residues that were changed by Rosetta Relax design)
* Maximum per residue score: 0.1
